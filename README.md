  Hello Team! My name is Rick, and I am excited to work on a group project with y'all! When not in front of my computer, and depending on the season, I try to stay active with snowboarding, jiu-jitsu, softball, and attending live music events 🤘

  - Hello! My name is Porter Ballou, and I look forward to working on this project. Honestly, I can't pick a favorite hobby... programming, drawing, making music, game development, lifting--I like a lot of things! Not running, though. *shudder*
